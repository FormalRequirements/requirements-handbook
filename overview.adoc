WARNING: Work in progress!

This chapter is an overview of {method}.
It aims at making this companion book self-content.
We highly recommend, for more details and a full description of the subtleties of {method}, to read the corresponding {hb-pdf}[handbook].
Besides, this chapter does not cover the following aspects of {method} that {hb-pdf}[handbook] fully addresses:

- General principles of requirements (see {hb-pdf}[handbook], chapter 2)
- Quality criteria for requirements (see {hb-pdf}[handbook], chapter 4)
- How to write requirements (see {hb-pdf}[handbook], chapter 6)
- Completeness (see {hb-pdf}[handbook], chapter 11)
- Verification (see {hb-pdf}[handbook], chapter 12)

== Basic principles

{method} takes its name from the proposed organization of requirements in four books (<<structure>> will detail this books' structure): 

Process:: dedicated to...
Environment::
Goals::
System::
Bla

NOTE: All this document will follow, as much as possible, the color convention illustrated by the logo (see <<logo>>).


[[structure]]
== Overall structure

NOTE: This structure can be used to organize a document in books, but also requirements in packages (for example in <<templates,SysML>>) or in folders (for example in a spreadsheet).
